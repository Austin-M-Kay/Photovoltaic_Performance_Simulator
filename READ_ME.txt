If you need help installing Anaconda, see the pdf 'EQE_Analyser_Tool_Manual'.

Moreover, the manual gives instructions on how to open Jupyer via Anaconda,

and how to navigate the GUI.

-

If you would like to see the fully-commented Jupyter notebook, open 

'EQE_Analyser_Tool_1.0.ipynb'. Alternatively, if you would just like to use

the interface, open 'Bare_EQE_Analyser_Tool_1.0.ipynb'. Running the latter 

will execute the secondary Python script 'EQE_Analyser_Tool_1.0.py', which 

contains all the code.

-

Additional EQE spectra may be added in '.xlsx' Excel files to the folder 

'EQE_Spectra'. Additional photon flux spectra should be added as new sheets 

to the 'Spectra.xlsx' Excel file in the 'Spectra' folder.

The most up-to-date version of the code will always be available on the 

GitHub profile:
