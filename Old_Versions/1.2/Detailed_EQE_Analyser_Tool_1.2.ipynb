    "### Synopsis\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "This computational tool was created to estimate the performance of a photovoltaic devices under arbitrary illumination conditions. The default spectra that the tool has been made with are the 'warm white' 2700K LED, the 'cool white' 4000K LED, the CIE Standard Illuminant LED-B4, and the standard AM1.5G spectrum for sunlight. Additional specta can be added as new sheets in the \"Spectra.xlsx\" Excel file. The tool can be used to estimate performance using either a simulated photovoltaic external quantum efficiency ($\\mathrm{EQE}_\\mathrm{PV}$) spectrum (including step functions, sub-gap Urbach tails, and detailed models for organic semiconductor absorption), or an experimentally-determined $\\mathrm{EQE}_\\mathrm{PV}$ spectrum (which must be saved in an Excel file in the \"EQE_Spectra\" folder); the latter will give a realistic estimate for the photovoltaic performance of real devices.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Two types of simulation can be performed with this tool: (i) figures-of-merit versus the optical gap, and (ii) figures-of-merit versus the intensity of the incident light. For both simulated and experimental $\\mathrm{EQE}_\\mathrm{PV}$, non-radiative open-circuit voltage losses can be included in the simulations using different models, including an emprical model contributed by Maura Fitzsimons. These losses are explored further in the manuscript this computational tool accompanies.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The following content may be broken into four main sections, followed by the user interface. Firstly, the theoretical background supporting the tool is outlined (alongside the functions that implement it) in [Section 1](#Theoretical_Background). Following this, in [Section 2](#Loading_Spectra), the irradiance spectra are loaded into the script and converted to photon flux spectra. Next, in [Section 3](#Making_Interface), the widgets needed to create the User Interface are defined, linked, and compiled. Following this, in [Section 4](#Support), additional tools used to support the code's operation are defined, including an interpolating function. Finally, in [Section 5](#Interface), the user interface is presented; __to quickly load and use the user interface, select \"Cell $\\to$ Run All\" from the top of the screen__.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; While every care has been taken to ensure no faults or bugs are present in this tool, we would like to correct any issues users may have - please report these to (A.M. Kay) 954708@swansea.ac.uk. The most up-to-date version of this tool (and its manual) will always be available at https://github.com/Austin-M-Kay.\n",
