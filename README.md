# Photovoltaic_Performance_Simulator
A Jupyter-based tool with graphical user interface for simulating photovoltaic performance under arbitrary illumination conditions.

This tool is based on the theory outlined in:

Kay, A.M., Fitzsimons, M.E., Burwell, G., Meredith, P., Armin, A. and Sandberg, O.J. (2023), The Thermodynamic Limit of Indoor Photovoltaics Based on Energetically-Disordered Molecular Semiconductors. Sol. RRL. Accepted Author Manuscript. https://doi.org/10.1002/solr.202300277
