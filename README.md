# Photovoltaic_Performance_Simulator
A Jupyter-based tool with graphical user interface for simulating photovoltaic performance under arbitrary illumination conditions.

This tool is based on the theory outlined in:

Kay, A. M., Fitzsimons, M.,  Burwell, G., Meredith, P., Armin, A., & Sandberg, O.J.,
The Thermodynamic Limits of Indoor Photovoltaics Based on Energetically-Disordered Semiconductors. 
(Available as a pre-print on the open-access repository arXiv).
